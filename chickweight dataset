START

    LOAD ChickWeight dataset
    
    (i) ORDER dataset by "weight" in ascending order, grouped by "Diet"
        - Extract last 6 records from ordered data
        - PRINT last 6 records

    LOAD "reshape2" library

    (ii.a) MELT data using "Chick", "Time", and "Diet" as ID variables
        - PRINT first few rows of melted data

    (ii.b) CAST melted data to compute mean weight grouped by Diet
        - PRINT mean weight by Diet

    (ii.c) DEFINE mode function
        - APPLY mode function to weight grouped by Diet using `dcast()`
        - PRINT mode weight by Diet
