START

    LOAD Titanic dataset
    CONVERT Titanic dataset into a DataFrame
    
    (a) DRAW bar chart for "Survived" grouped by "Class"
        - Use ggplot2 with geom_bar()

    (b) MODIFY bar chart to group by "Class" and split by "Sex"
        - Use facet_wrap(~ Sex) to separate by gender

    (c) DRAW histogram to show distribution of "Age"
        - Use ggplot2 with geom_histogram()
        - Set bin width to 5 for better clarity
